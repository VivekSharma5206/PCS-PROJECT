End-to-End Digital Communication System Simulator
A modular Python-based implementation of an end-to-end baseband digital communication system. The project simulates the complete transmitter–receiver chain, including PCM generation, line coding, pulse shaping, AWGN channel modeling, matched filtering, eye-diagram analysis, and BER performance evaluation.

Features
Signal generation using configurable sinusoidal sources
Uniform sampling and quantization
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
Polar NRZ, Unipolar NRZ, and Bipolar AMI line coding
Rectangular and Raised Cosine pulse shaping
AWGN channel simulation
Matched filter receiver
Eye diagram analysis
Bit detection and BER computation
BER vs SNR (Waterfall Curve) generation
